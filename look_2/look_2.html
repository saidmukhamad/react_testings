                            Damien Hirst is to exhibit his latest paintings, ‘Cherry Blossoms’, at Fondation Cartier in Paris. The solo exhibition will open in spring 2021.
    
                            The result of two years of intense work in his London studio, the series is part of Hirst’s career-long investigation into painting. 
        
                            The Cherry Blossoms were begun shortly after Hirst’s sculptural project ‘Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable’ (2017). Referencing both Impressionism and Pointillism, as well as Action Painting, the series revisit the spontaneous joy of painting. 
        
                            The imagined mechanical painter, omnipresent in the ‘Spot’ and ‘Spin Paintings’ series, is replaced in the ‘Cherry Blossoms’ series by the fallibility of the hand of the artist working in his studio.

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>The Cherry Blossoms are about beauty and life and death. They’re extreme – there’s something almost tacky about them. Like Jackson Pollock twisted by love. They’re decorative but taken from nature. They’re about desire and how we process the things around us and what we turn them into, but also about the insane visual transience of beauty – a tree in full crazy blossom against a clear sky. It’s been so good to make them, to be completely lost in colour and in paint in my studio. They’re garish and messy and fragile and about me moving away from Minimalism and the idea of an imaginary mechanical painter and that’s so exciting to me. - Damien Hirst</p>

                        Gagosian Gallery New York to present the first US exhibition of Hirst's 2016 'Colour Space' paintings series, following their debut at Houghton Hall earlier this year. The solo exhibition, entitled 'Colour Space Paintings', will open May 4th. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Evolving from the iconic Spot Paintings, which are among Hirst’s most recognized works, the Colour Space paintings revisit the free and spontaneous nature of his first two spot paintings from 1986, exactly thirty years later.
                        <blockquote>
                            As Hirst recalls
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                            'My first ever Spot Painting was loose and painted with drippy paint and not minimal at all. In that painting, I was wrestling with what I originally thought of as the coldness of Minimalism and the more emotional Abstract Expressionist painting style I’d grown up with. At the time I painted it, it felt uncool and I abandoned it immediately for the rigidity of the grid, removing the mess, but after doing the Spot catalogue raisonné I’ve felt really drawn to that first painting and knew I’d revisit it eventually.'
                        </blockquote> 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        While the Spot Paintings were originally conceived as an endless series, the Colour Space paintings are a finite body of work, commenced and completed in 2016. The latter adhere to some of the formal rules established for the Spot Paintings: no single color is ever repeated in a painting, and the dot size—ranging from one quarter of an inch to four inches in diameter—is consistent within each work. However, without the logic of the grid and the symmetry of the perfect circle, the Colour Space paintings appear looser, more stochastic, and more open to incident than the Spot Paintings. Here, Hirst’s imperfect discs overlap and jostle in a riot of color, like so many particles under a microscope.
                    </p>

                    <p>The exhibition directly follows Hirst’s showing of the Veil Paintings at Gagosian Beverly Hills, which opened in March. In the Veil Paintings, Hirst revisited his Visual Candy series of the early nineties, in which vivid colors overlap in loose ovals of thick impasto or pointillist-style dots. The Colour Space paintings similarly reveal the interplay in his approach between the systematic and the painterly, the rational and the expressive.</p>

                    Gagosian will present Damien Hirst’s latest series, the 'Veil Paintings' as the 2018 Oscars show, a much-anticipated annual fixture in the Los Angeles cultural calendar. Hirst’s last exhibition in Los Angeles was 'The Complete Spot Paintings' in 2012.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Following 'Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable', his highly ambitious sculpture exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi and Punta della Dogana in Venice last year, Hirst was drawn towards the immediacy of painting and a return to the studio. This new series takes the 'Visual Candy' paintings of the 1990s as a point of departure and embraces colour and gestural painting on a large scale. Referencing both Impressionism and Abstract Expressionism, the 'Veil Paintings' layer brushstrokes and bright dabs of heavy impasto, enveloping the viewer in vast fields of colour.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Inspired partly by the Pointillist innovations of Georges Seurat and the post-Impressionist paintings of Pierre Bonnard, Hirst continues his examination of colour and its effect on the eye in the 'Veil Paintings'. While in the 'Spot Paintings' and 'Medicine Cabinet' series, his use of colour was contained within the formality of the grid and the minimalist pharmaceutical packaging, here it is given free reign, with joyous results.

                <p>Hirst's iconic series of prints, 'The Last Supper', is now on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. </p>

                <p>'The Last Supper' is a series of thirteen screenprints that depicts pharmaceutical packaging with the medicine’s name replaced with that of food common on British canteen menus.</p>
                <p>The series was originally shown as part of ‘Art in Sacred Spaces’ (2000), in which exhibitions were held in practising places of worship across London with the intention of creating a dialogue between artists and faith communities. Hirst’s contribution was shown at St Stephen’s Church in Islington. In 2001, he was awarded the Ljubljana Biennial Grand Prize for ‘The Last Supper’ and consequently invited to put on his first exhibition of drawings, ‘From the Cradle to the Grave’, in 2003.</p>
                <p>As in ‘Pharmacy’ (1992), and with the ‘Medicine Cabinets’ series, ‘The Last Supper’ shows Hirst’s interest in the Minimalist aesthetic appeal of medical packaging, which Hirst has likened to the work of Donald Judd and Sol LeWitt. ‘The Last Supper’ forms part of Hirst’s ongoing examination of the role of religion and science in contemporary society. On discussing the basis for the series he states: “Where’s God now? God’s fucked off. So all these big issues – like art and science and cancer – are all clambering about on this barren landscape where God used to exist.” The prints use humour to comment upon this modern confusion whilst also passing comment on the pharmaceutical industry: “[The packages] aren’t flamboyant are they? They’re not allowed to sell themselves, except in a very clinical way, which starts to become funny.” For the artist, humour is an important and frequently employed tool, which he describes as “a by-product of thinking about creating meaning through the relationships of objects”.</p>
                <p>Hirst intended that the thirteen prints of ‘The Last Supper’ should always be shown together, as it is in Washington D.C., replicating those present at the biblical account of Jesus’s Last Supper.</p>
